# Sidechain UI Godot Addon

🚧 Under construction

This application is built using [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)

This is intended to be a Godot Addon that handles the majority of the Sidechain UI.

The project is a basic Godot project containing the addon for development.

The goal is to be able to create a seperate project for each sidechain and import this addon
to handle most of the UI. Such that the work for the UI that is almost identical does not have to
be repeated in each project.

This work is not complete as it mostly containes custom theme work and the basic window layout. There
is more to do.

## Development Enviornment Prerequisites

- Godot 4.1.1 [Download Page](https://godotengine.org/download)

Currently only scripted in GDScript, but we could use the .NET version of Godot which brings C# support

Once you've gotten your development environment setup

- Clone repo
- Open the project and run
